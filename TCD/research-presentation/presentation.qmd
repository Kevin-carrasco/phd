- Public perceptions of distributive justice

:::

## Research question {data-background-color="#5f5758"}

::: {.black .slarge}

How do individual beliefs about inequality shape perceptions of redistributive justice across OECD countries, and to what extent are these perceptions conditioned by country-level characteristics?

:::

## Meritocracy and social mobility beliefs

::: {.incremental .highlight-last style="font-size: 100%;"}

- Meritocracy is fundamental to determining how individuals evaluate justice of social and economic outcomes

- People who see success as merit-based are more likely to legitimize inequality and oppose redistribution

- Individuals attributing poverty to lack of effort or ambition tend to support more restrictive welfare policies and perceive benefict recipients as undeserving

:::

## Data and methods

- [Risks that matter survey 2022](https://www.oecd.org/en/data/datasets/risks-that-matter-data-and-methodology.html)

- Cross-national survey assesses perceptions of social and economic risks and related policy preferences

- Conducted in 25 OECD countries (Austria, Belgium, Canada, **Chile**, Denmark, Finalnd, France, Germany, **Ireland**...)

- Central dependent variable: Redistributive justice:

*"I feel that I receive a fair share of public benefits, given the taxes and social contributions I pay and/or have paid in the past"*
